          The FinTech Club at VIT Bhopal has conceived an engaging event called
          'The Wiki Race Tournament', which aims to challenge participants to
          navigate through Wikipedia's vast knowledge repository in order to
          travel from a specified origin to a predetermined destination.
          <br />
          <br /> This thrilling competition will be divided into three distinct
          rounds, wherein teams will be tested on their ability to rapidly
          navigate the intricate web of Wikipedia.
          <br />
          <br />
          The team that successfully reaches the destination in the shortest
          time will be declared the victor of each round, and will be rewarded
          with thrilling prizes as a token of appreciation for their outstanding
          performance.
